# Solving a Linear Program via a Single Unconstrained Minimization

This repository contains Python implementations of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 from our paper, **["Solving a Linear Program via a Single Unconstrained Minimization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21232)**.

## Contents

- `algorithm1.py`: Implements Algorithm 1.
- `algorithm2.py`: Implements Algorithm 2.
- `algorithm1_functions.py`: Functions for Algorithm 1.
- `algorithm2_functions.py`: Functions for Algorithm 2.
- `problem_set.zip`: Test problems that have been solved in the paper.

Each algorithm script includes code for generating random linear programs (both with optimal solutions and unbounded cases).
